# NER-Tensorflow-Attempt
Attempt at doing NER with Tensorflow, for DataPassports

model.py consists of the data preprocessing and building of the model

webscraper.py includes the webscraping and preprocessing to get it ready to be fed into the model

The checkpoints/weights for the model is too big to upload onto GitHub here, I've attached it via email.

The project isn't fully complete as I've ran into some issues with the dimensions of my tensors, and thus couldn't get it to make predictions.
